## Audit & Assurance Services

Trust is the foundation of every business relationship. Our audit and assurance services provide the independent perspective that stakeholders—investors, lenders, regulators, and boards—rely on to make informed decisions.

### Financial Statement Audits

Our audit teams apply professional skepticism and deep industry knowledge to deliver high-quality audits that meet professional standards and stakeholder expectations. We communicate clearly and address issues proactively.

### SOC Examinations

Service organizations need to demonstrate the effectiveness of their controls to customers and their auditors. We perform SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3 examinations that provide the assurance your customers require.

### Employee Benefit Plan Audits

Fiduciary responsibility requires rigorous oversight of retirement plans. Our specialists understand the unique regulatory and reporting requirements for 401(k)s, pension plans, and other employee benefit arrangements.
